The fruit of a unique combination of mechanical engineering and software, NAO is a character made up of
a multitude of sensors, motors and software piloted by a made-to-measure operating system: NAOqi OS.

7 senses for natural interaction

Moving : 25 degrees of freedom and a humanoid shape that enable him to move and adapt to the world around him. 
His inertial unit enables him to maintain his balance and to know whether he is standing up or lying down.

Feeling : The numerous sensors in his head, hands and feet, as well as his sonars, enable him to perceive
his environment and get his bearings.
  
Hearing and speaking : With his 4 directional microphones and loudspeakers, 
NAO interacts with humans in a completely natural manner, by listening and speaking.

Seeing : NAO is equipped with two cameras that film his environment in high 
resolution, helping him to recognise shapes and objects.

Connecting : To access the Internet autonomously, NAO is able to use a 
range of different connection modes (WiFi, Ethernet).

Thinking : We can't really talk about "Artificial Intelligence" with NAO, 
but the robots are already able to reproduce human behaviour.

 
NAO is designed to be personalised: add content, using a variety of capacities, enriching his
personality and even developing new skills and know-how. NAO is your robot and the Choregraphe 
software will help you to personalise him.
