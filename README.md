Webots is a development environment used to model, program and simulate mobile robots. With Webots the user
can design complex robotic setups, with one or several, similar or different robots, in a shared environment. The properties 
of each object, such as shape, color, texture, mass, friction, etc., are chosen by the user. A large choice of simulated sensors
and actuators is available to equip each robot. The robot controllers can be programmed with the built-in IDE or with third party
development environments. The robot behavior can be tested in physically realistic worlds. The controller programs can optionally 
be transferred to commercially available real robots. Webots is used by over 1309 universities and research centers worldwide.
With Webots, you take advantage of a proven technology that has been codeveloped by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology 
in Lausanne, thoroughly tested, well documented and continuously maintained for over 20 years. The development time you save is 
enormous!
